# Neo4j Graph Database
In this project I presented data from the "Friends" series by Neo4j.
The graph shows relationships and types of relationships between nodes.
## Features

-  API
- Docker platform
## Folder Structure & Explanation of files
There are 2 types of nodes: 
  - Apartment - Apartment.py
  - person - Person.py
  
I created a class for each type of node.
- Graph_friends.py - Creating connections between nodes 
- API.py - Creating an interface to the graph
- Dockerfile - Running on the Docker platform
- driver_connection.py - connection to the Neo4j Graph Database (It is necessary to update login information every time because it is a free login)
- graph.png - results
- package-lock.json
